If I were a queen for a day, oh the changes I would make
    *[We can help make that a reality.]
    *[You want to see change?]
    *[It's a new dawn, the queen is not long for this town]
    
- How would I do something like that?
    *[It’s simple, we kill them]
    *[Together we can make a difference]
    *[Join us, in numbers we stop their tyranny]
    
- Oh joy! I can’t wait to wear the crown…I’m in
