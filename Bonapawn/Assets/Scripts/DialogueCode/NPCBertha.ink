    *[I know right?]
    *[Ooo look at me, I can move so far in one step, I’m so fancy!]
    *[Rich people amiright?]
    
- I’m glad to hear someone else agrees. Always been on my nerves.
    *[Help me kill them.]
    *[I’m overthrowing them, join us!]
    *[Their cup has runneth over, time for a change.]
